## Description

It's the year 2057. The world is being
ruled by a corrupt council known as **The EYE**

A small group of freedom fighters codenamed the **HARPOCRATES**
must rise to restore peace,
balance and sanity to our World.

To this effect, I was assigned the mammoth task of building a secure communication channel accessible only by fellow Harpocates via the Command Line Interface

I must hurry ðŸ¦€

## Overview
